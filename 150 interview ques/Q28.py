# This code calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of n.
# Trailing zeroes are created by factors of 10, and since 10 is the product of 2 and 5,
# the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers 
# from 1 to n (since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial).
#
# The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing n by 5 to count:
# 1. Multiples of 5 (such as 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.).
# 2. Higher powers of 5 (like 25, 125, etc.), which contribute additional factors of 5.
#
# The sum of these counts gives the total number of trailing zeroes in n!.
# The loop stops when n becomes less than 5, as higher powers of 5 no longer contribute.
#
# This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(logâ‚…(n)), making it much faster
# than directly calculating the factorial of n.
